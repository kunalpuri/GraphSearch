# GraphSearch
Implementation of BFS, DFS, and Dijkstras on Weighted/Directed Graphs.

# Statement of Interest
This project was done for my MATH 3134 (Combinatorics) course. This project was completed by myself. I chose this project because I am extremely interested in graph theory in the realm of computer science. I think Graphs are one of the most applicable data structures in CS and mastering the basic searches is important. I find graph theory very interesting because I realized that many applications (social networks, maps, computer networks) are designed using graphs. In addition, it is a field that is continually being studied so there is always something new to learn. Another reason I found this interesting is because I always have a slight challenge when converting math concepts to code. I enjoy this challenge so I wanted to code some implementations of graph traversals.

# To Run
Download all the code in the GraphSearch directory. Simply run Main.java and input a test file name (Inputs/TESTFILENAMEHERE.txt).
